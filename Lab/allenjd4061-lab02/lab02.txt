After the code was executed, the array contained the
elements {0, 4, 11, 0, 44, 0, 4195376, 2}. The output
received was not expected. The value of data[6] was
extraneous. This is due to the value of data[6] never
being assigned in the code. This caused the program
to print whatever was previously stored in memory.
